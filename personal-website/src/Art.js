                    This piece of art was printed on vinyl 
                    and applied onto a traffic signal box 
                    in Ponca City, Oklahoma. The Ponca City 
                    Main Street organization held a competition 
                    for art to help add art to the public.

                    In middle school I designed and painted this 
                    mural as a part of my art class. This mural 
                    can be found painted on the wall in Classen 
                    School of Advanced Studies Middle School. It 
                    is made to resemble a color wheel because it 
                    is located outside an art classroom.

                    This piece was created on the side of a 
                    Scissortail Waste Solutions dumpster 
                    during Sunny Days Mural Fest in August 
                    of 2021. The Sunny Days mentorship 
                    program paired me up with a wonderful 
                    pair of ladies that helped me develop 
                    a plan to move forward with my project. 
                    This work is an actively used as a traveling 
                    dumpster.
